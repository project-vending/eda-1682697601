However, I can recommend that you use Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to perform EDA on your dataset. You can start by loading the dataset into a pandas dataframe and using the info() function to check for nulls. Then you can use matplotlib and seaborn to create different visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to explore the distribution of each column.", "outputs": []}]}
